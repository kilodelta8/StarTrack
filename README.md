Star Track Project: Satellite Tracking AntennaPhase 1: Planning and System Design (Steps 1 & 2)This phase defines the system architecture, chooses the core components, and finalizes the requirements for the hardware and software.1.1 System Architecture OverviewThe system will use a three-tier architecture:Presentation/Calculation Layer (Flask Web App): Handles TLE data, orbital mechanics calculations, user interface, satellite selection, and scheduling.Communication Layer (Wi-Fi Module): Provides a wireless link between the Flask app (local network) and the microcontroller.Control Layer (Arduino Uno): Receives target Azimuth and Elevation coordinates, drives the stepper motors, and executes the tracking sequence.1.2 Component Selection (Preliminary)ComponentPurposePreliminary SelectionNotesMicrocontrollerMotor control and interfaceArduino UnoConfirmed by user.ConnectivityWi-Fi communicationESP32 or ESP8266ESP32 is preferred for better performance and simultaneous Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capabilities, potentially simplifying the Flask-Arduino link.Motors (2x)Azimuth (Rotation) & Elevation (Angle)NEMA 17 Stepper MotorsGood torque and precision.

Must ensure zero backlash (or minimal) for accurate tracking.Tripod Integration: Secure the Azimuth motor/gear mechanism to the tripod base.Alignment: Integrate a mechanism or bubble level to accurately set the base to True North and zero degrees elevation.2.2 Electronics WiringWire the Arduino Uno, the ESP module (Wi-Fi), the two stepper drivers, and the power supply.Ensure the motor power and Arduino/ESP power are correctly isolated or regulated.2.3 Stepper CalibrationDetermine the steps-per-degree ratio for both the Azimuth and Elevation axes. This is crucial for accurate movement.Phase 3: Software Development and Integration (Step 4)This phase involves writing and testing the three core software pieces.3.1 Flask Web ApplicationUI: Develop a responsive interface to select the current location (GPS coordinates), input TLE data, select a satellite, and define the start/end time for tracking.Orbital Calculation Logic: Implement the Python code to perform the SGP4 calculation and generate a list of Az/El target points over time (e.g., every 1-5 seconds).Communication Endpoint: Create an API endpoint (/track) that sends the calculated point list to the ESP module via HTTP POST or WebSockets.3.2 Arduino Firmware (Uno + ESP Module)Wi-Fi Listener: Program the ESP module to connect to the "junk Wi-Fi router" and listen for incoming tracking data from the Flask app.Command Parsing: Develop code on the Arduino to receive, parse, and store the Az/El point list.Motor Control: Implement a precise motion control routine. This must handle:Interpolation: Smooth movement between commanded Az/El points.Timing: Using the onboard clock (or time synced from the ESP) to hit each coordinate at the correct time.Phase 4: Testing, Calibration, and Reporting (Steps 5, 6, & 7)The final stages involve rigorous testing and documentation.4.1 Unit TestingTest the Flask SGP4 calculator against known satellite paths.Test the Arduino's stepper control for movement accuracy (degrees moved vs. commanded degrees).Test the Wi-Fi connection and data transfer reliability.4.2 System Integration and Field TestPerform a full end-to-end test: Flask calculates, sends data, Arduino tracks.Field Calibration: Calibrate the system in the field, aligning it to True North and adjusting for any mechanical offsets or errors in the Az/El calculation.4.3 Documentation and Final ReportFinalize the Build Instructions (Step 6) including parts lists, assembly diagrams, and wiring schematics.Prepare the Final Report (Step 7) detailing the design choices, test results (accuracy), and potential improvements.This plan gives us a solid roadmap. The next step, Step 2: Refine each section of the plan, will involve diving into the technical details for component selection, the communication protocol, and the specific libraries we'll use.Which section of this master plan would you like to refine first? We could start with the preliminary Component Selection (1.2) to nail down the exact hardware.
